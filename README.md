# beta_eloss
 LET and Range of Electrons in Custom Materials

 This code is a simple ROOT macro that uses Energy Loss tables from estar 
 to calculate the range and stopping power of electrons/beta- in various 
 materials. 

 The estar calculator is found here: 
 https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Star/Text/ESTAR.html

 Simply save the tabulated data from estar by clicking "Download Data". Change
 the file path in the .C file point at the estar tabulated data.
